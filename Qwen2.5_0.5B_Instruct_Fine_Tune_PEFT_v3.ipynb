If Carla drank 15 ounces of water, how many ounces were subtracted from the amount of soda she drank?\n### Answer:\nLet's call the number of ounces subtracted from the soda \"x.\"\n\nCarla drank 15 ounces of water. Since she drank three times as much soda as water, she would have drunk 3 * 15 = 45 ounces of soda without any subtraction.\n\nHowever, we know that she drank a total of 54 ounces of liquid. So, the water and the actual amount of soda she drank (after subtracting x ounces) should add up to 54 ounces.\n\nSo, we have:\n15 ounces (water) + (45 ounces - x) (soda) = 54 ounces (total)\n\nNow, let's solve for x:\n15 + 45 - x = 54\n60 - x = 54\nx = 60 - 54\nx = 6 ounces\n\nTherefore, 6 ounces were subtracted from the amount of soda she would have drunk.<|im_end|>\n",
