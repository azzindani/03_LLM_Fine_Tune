If B multiplied by 10 plus A is 9 less than A multiplied by 10 plus B, what is the first number?\n### Answer:\nLet's denote the two-digit number as \\( XY \\), where \\( X \\) is the digit in the tens place and \\( Y \\) is the digit in the ones place. Since the tens place is 3, we have \\( X = 3 \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, \\( A \\) is the quotient of the number by 10, and \\( B \\) is the remainder of the division by 10. Therefore, \\( A = X = 3 \\) and \\( B = Y \\).\n\nThe problem states that \\( B \\times 10 + A \\) is 9 less than \\( A \\times 10 + B \\). This can be written as an equation:\n\n\\[ B \\times 10 + A = A \\times 10 + B - 9 \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) with \\( 3 \\) and \\( Y \\), respectively, we get:\n\n\\[ Y \\times 10 + 3 = 3 \\times 10 + Y - 9 \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n\\[ 10Y + 3 = 30 + Y - 9 \\]\n\n\\[ 10Y + 3 = Y + 21 \\]\n\nSubtract \\( Y \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[ 9Y + 3 = 21 \\]\n\nSubtract 3 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 9Y = 18 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 9:\n\n\\[ Y = 2 \\]\n\nSo the ones place digit is 2. Since we already know the tens place digit is 3, the two-digit number is \\( 32 \\).<|eot_id|>\n",
